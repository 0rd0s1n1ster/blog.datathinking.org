## Doing
- [ ] Clean Data Thinking Zulip chat data, located at https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace/blob/main/data/datathinking.zulipchat.com/raw/messages-000001.json - put it in a `polars` dataframe and compute summary statistics of the dataset
- [ ] Analyze this Zulip chat data using logistic regression, linear regression, and embeddings with the tools we have learned in the lectures (don't forget to ask ChatGPT, Claude, Lex, GPT-4 for help as much as you need, and ask for help on the Data Thinking Zulip chat :)
- [ ] Create a visualization of either logistic or linear regression, or an embeddings analysis of the Data Thinking Zulip chat data
- [ ] Make a copy of the Overleaf template: https://www.overleaf.com/read/ghpyzqwqwxpv
- [ ] Review collaborative whiteboards from past classes: listed at https://www.datathinking.org/university-of-tartu
- [ ] Review Jupyter notebooks from past classes: 
    - https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace/blob/main/notebooks/230313-embeddings-volume-2.ipynb
    - https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace/blob/main/notebooks/230316-embeddings-text-data-like-chat-logs-and-networks.ipynb
