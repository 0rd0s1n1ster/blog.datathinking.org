There are many ways to join our team, get involved, sponsor us, or work with us in any capacity you see fit:

# Google Summer of Code

To work with us through Google Summer of Code, please email us at hello@onefact.org with the following:

* your CV
* answers to the following questions:
  - Why are you interested in working on this with us?
  - What other commitments do you have besides working with us on this, and how can we support you in meeting those commitments during the program?
  - How have you stayed organized and communicated during other projects such as this? What should collaborators know about your preferred working or communication styles and tools?
* which open source projects you are interested in working on, for example from this list: https://onefact.org/project-ideas
* a set of milestones you believe are feasible to complete during the program, and what the resources and support you would need to complete the milestones

Getting feedback on your submission: you can email us at hello@onefact.org with your draft and we can help you understand if it is feasible. Alternatively, you can also join our chat room: https://onefact.zulipchat.com and ask for help completing your proposal there. Asking for help is encouraged, and the best applicants usually decide to ask for help!
