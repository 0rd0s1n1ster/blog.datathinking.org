- [ ] Get a blank piece of paper (or tablet) with nothing on it
- [ ] Write down things you want to start with, even if it is only completing this checklist! (Principle: this helps reduce your cognitive load, and helps emotional regulation -- we can only hold about 7 things in working memory, and if one or several of those are emotional responses to the stress of learning or impostor syndrome or anxiety, that prevents learning.)
- [ ] In Visual Studio code, clone a repository using your GitHub account from the `Source Control` pane of the explorer panel
- [ ] Make a change in the repository to a file (such as this markdown file)
- [ ] Commit this change in the `Source Control` panel of Visual Studio code
- [ ] Push this change to GitHub to a remote repository
- [ ] Send the link to this remote repository to someone so you can be proud of what you did!
- [ ] Learn to browse the file system locally or on github
