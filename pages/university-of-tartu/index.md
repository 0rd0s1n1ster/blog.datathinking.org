title: Humanity-Centered Data Thinking 
description: Using empathy, with design thinking as a model and metaphor, we enable clear understanding of how to work with data to make considered and impactful decisions. We automate teaching away using GPT-4 and other large language models.

**This pilot course focuses on the `feel`, `ask`, `do`, `think` workflow to guide practitioners of data thinking from data to decisions.**

Premise:

You don't trust numbers.

But you need numbers to make decisions. 

Numbers, represented on a computer, must be finite: computers do not have infinite memory. 

Further, the universe is expanding: one can never out-compete the second law of thermodynamics, stating that entropy (read: "randomness") must increase. 

These constraints make it necessary to find fast algorithms to process data in order to find patterns in this data.

These patterns are the basis of data thinking. 

Crucially, data thinking requires understanding of the stories behind the humans that collected, measured, curated, and disseminated or data used to inform decisions. These stories help understand what was included, what was excluded, and what could reasonably be expected of a particular dataset. 

Further, data thinking requires visualization. 

Finally, asking for help is hard for all of us. 

The first basic principle of data thinking is to `ask`: 

* to ask for help
* to ask a research question
* to ponder
* to ask why, how, and what for. 

The course is oriented around the `feel`, `ask`, `do`, `think` workflow. 

Concepts from psychology make an appearance, such as self-monitoring, or noticing emotional responses to verbal stimuli (such as thoughts or words associated with an experience). These basic tools can help accelerate learning and expose learners to uncertainty in an environment of psychological safety. 

Such exposure to difficult, confusing contexts is vital for helping a learner traverse and navigate the tricky process of asking, answering, or refuting questions with data. Numbers are needed to make decisions, but numbers are not enough. 

Based on open-ended elicitation of learner feedback, Claude (a large language model built by Anthropic, whose Series B round was led by Sam Bankman-Fried) summarized the following operational definition:


> Based on these learner definitions, here is an operational definition of "data thinking" for our class:
> 
> Data thinking is the mental process of analyzing, interpreting, and deriving meaning from data in order to understand and make decisions about the world. It involves:
> * Converting data into information and knowledge through logical and sometimes creative thinking. This includes categorizing, computing, reasoning, rationalizing, as well as making correlations and intuiting causation.
> * Asking questions about how the data was collected and making assumptions in order to comprehend its meaning. This includes considering what is included or excluded and why.
> * Connecting datasets and individual data points together through grouping, categorizing, and storytelling in order build a coherent understanding.
> * Translating data insights into subjective experiences and using them to explain, predict, gain perspective, or make judgements about real-world phenomenon.
> * Recognizing that data and thinking are interconnected and co-constructed. Data both shapes and is shaped by how we think about and make sense of the world.
> * Continually optimizing and reconsidering one's mental models in light of new data. Data thinking is an iterative process of reframing one's understanding.
> * In summary, data thinking is the active, inquisitive, and meaning-making cognitive process of understanding the world through data. It is a skill that can be developed and honed over time with practice.
